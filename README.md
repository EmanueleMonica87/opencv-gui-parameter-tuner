Building a GUI tool to find the right parameters visually and quickly, for various Computer Vision algorithms 

This is Work in Progress.

Currently you can find parameters for following algorithms: 
  - **Smoothing an image**, with one filter or with a combination of up to 4 different types of filters:
    - Provides Average Filter Size, Gaussian Filter Size, Median Filter Size, Bilateral Filter Size
  - **Canny Edge Detection**:
    - Provides Upper Threshold, Lower Threshold, Gaussian Filter Size
